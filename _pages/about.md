## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Nishikant Dhamane

I am a Principal Site Reliability Engineer with 14+ years of experience in delivering high-availability, cost-efficient, and secure platforms across enterprise and healthcare domains. My focus lies in combining **cloud infrastructure**, **data engineering**, and **SRE principles** to build resilient systems that scale with business needs.

Currently at **Providence Health & Services**, I lead global SRE initiatives to optimize platform reliability, security, and cost-efficiency. Notably, I designed a **centralized telemetry platform** and an **enterprise data lake** that dramatically reduced MTTR and data duplication across clinical and non-clinical systems.

Previously at **Microsoft**, I worked on cloud-scale telemetry pipelines, DR failover strategies, TLS termination, and global load balancingâ€”supporting external and internal users during high-traffic events.

My mission is to build systems that don't just detect failures but predict and prevent them using intelligent telemetry, automation, and observability.

### ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- **Cloud**: Azure (IaaS/PaaS), Azure DevOps, Azure Data Factory, Databricks
- **IaC**: Terraform, Bicep
