## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Nishikant Dhamane

Iâ€™m a Principal Engineer with 14+ years of experience driving platform reliability, data engineering, and cloud transformation across healthcare and enterprise environments. My mission is to build systems that donâ€™t just detect failureâ€”but prevent itâ€”with intelligent automation, observability, and predictive insights.

At **Providence Health & Services**, I lead the development of scalable, resilient infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Bicep), enabling faster and safer deployments across mission-critical platforms. Iâ€™ve architected a centralized telemetry platform and an enterprise data lake, reducing MTTR by 30% and eliminating data silos across clinical and non-clinical systems.

Previously at **Microsoft**, I contributed to large-scale telemetry pipelines, global traffic routing, TLS termination, and high-availability strategies that supported millions of users during peak demand.

I thrive at the intersection of SRE, data platforms, and cloud architectureâ€”building solutions that align technical reliability with business outcomes. Iâ€™m also deeply passionate about enabling AI-driven operations, bringing AIOps into modern SRE practice to create self-healing, cost-aware systems.
