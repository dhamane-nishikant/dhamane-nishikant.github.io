## 👋 Welcome!

I'm **Nishikant Dhamane**, a Principal Engineer at Providence and former Microsoft technologist with 14+ years of experience in building scalable, reliable platforms across healthcare and enterprise environments.

I specialize in cloud infrastructure, data engineering, and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)—empowering organizations to predict, prevent, and resolve failures using automation, telemetry, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

🚀 At Providence, I’ve led enterprise-wide SRE and platform engineering efforts to reduce MTTR, standardize SLAs/OLAs, and deploy cloud-native services faster and more securely using Terraform and Bicep.

🧠 I’m passionate about enabling AI-driven reliability, intelligent observability, and data pipelines that power real-time decision-making across clinical systems.
